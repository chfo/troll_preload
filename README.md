troll_preload
===========

First of all, I am very sorry for this. Use this library to make your pedantic coadmins rage. Moreover, be less a dickhead and try the verbose variant to give them a hint! 

Usage
===========

<code> make </code>

<code> echo "export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/troll.so" >> ~/.basrc </code>
