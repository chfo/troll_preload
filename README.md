troll_preload
===========

First of all, I am very sorry for this. Use this library to make your pedantic coadmins rage. Moreover, be less a dickhead and try the verbose variant to give them a hint! Or be much more of a dickhead and try to get them into psych ward by using the psycho version.

Usage
===========

```bash
make
```
```bash
echo "export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/troll.so" >> ~/.bashrc
```
